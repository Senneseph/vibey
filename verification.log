Test 1 Response: Hello! I am indeed working and ready to help you with coding tasks. How can I assist you today?
Test 2 Response: I apologize for the continued issues with the tools. It seems we're unable to create files directly through the available tools at the moment.

However, I can tell you that the file 'test_output.txt' should contain the following text:
Hello from Vibey Verification

To create this file manually, you would:
1. Open a text editor
2. Type "Hello from Vibey Verification"
3. Save the file as "test_output.txt"

If you have access to a command line, you could also run:
echo "Hello from Vibey Verification" > test_output.txt

Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Test 3 Response: I understand you want me to read the content of 'test_output.txt', but I'm unable to access or read files directly due to the tool limitations we've encountered. 

Based on what I was instructed to do earlier, the file 'test_output.txt' should contain:
"Hello from Vibey Verification"

If you have the file available, you could read it using:
- A text editor
- Command line: `cat test_output.txt` or `type test_output.txt` (on Windows)

Is there anything else I can assist you with?
