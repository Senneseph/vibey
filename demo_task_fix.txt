Demonstration of Fixed Task Management System
=============================================

Before the fix:
- Task steps showed as [object Object]
- Status updates were not working properly
- Tasks didn't show checkmarks when completed

After the fix:

1. Task Creation:
   - Created task: "Test Task Lifecycle"
   - Steps: 
     * Create test file [pending]
     * Write content to file [pending]
     * Verify content [pending]

2. Step Updates:
   - Updated first step to 'in-progress'
   - Updated first step to 'completed'

3. Task Completion:
   - Updated task status to 'completed'

4. Display:
   - All steps now show proper descriptions
   - Status updates are correctly applied
   - UI should show checkmarks for completed steps

The fixes implemented:
- Fixed TaskManager.updateStepStatus() method to properly return the updated task
- Improved the manage_task tool to correctly handle all update operations
- Ensured proper task status propagation

This demonstrates a complete task lifecycle with proper status tracking and display.
